# Optical Flow Web

ðŸš§ **Work In Progress** ðŸš§

Fast implementation of Gunnar FarnebÃ¤ck optical flow, running in web browsers and fully accelerated in WebGL (for now) and WebGPU (will come next).

This project aim at implementing flexible APIs to:

- compute the dense polynomial expansion of pixels (to be used for any other need than optical flow calculation)
- compute the dense optical flow (displacement estimation) of the pixels between 2 images (e.g. 2 video frames)
- take as argument any kind of image source including GPU textures to avoid unnecessary CPU/GPU transfer
- provide the results in several ways including GPU textures to avoid unnecessary CPU/GPU transfer
- provide the most lightweight processing that could be plugged to neural networks running in web browsers on GPU
